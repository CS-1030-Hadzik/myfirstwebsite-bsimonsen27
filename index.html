                      <p class="card-text">Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game played by both young children and adults, "Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple. The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:" Rock wins againts scissors, scissors wins against papers, and paper wins against rock.

                      <p class="card-text">I really enjoy the outdoors, particularly the mountains. Fortunately, Utah is blessed with some of the most beautiful mountains in the world, that may be a bias opinion as I have only been to a few places with mountains. Mountain biking, fishing, and skiing are a few of the activities I enjoy doing while in the mountains. I graduated high school a couple years ago and decided to voluntarily be a missionary to share with other about my belief in Jesus Christ. I had a wonderful opportunity to live in Thailand for almost 2 years and it was an eye-opening and amazing experience. After that I returned home and am now pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, but I am open for change if I discover another course of study that interests me more. So far I have found this class to be interesting and educational. Already I have learned a lot more about computer science and I am excited to continue learning. Also, how would you create a new paragraph in Python? I'm going to look into it.</p>
